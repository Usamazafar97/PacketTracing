# computerNetworking
 Project contain the transmission of packets from one computer to other using inter and intra networking techniques(OSPF,RIP,EIGRP) with SUBNETING involved.Moreover NATING is used with ACL.
Instructions:

Using IP ADDRESSES : 104.174.205.17/12


You are given the network design with minimal technical documentation; your task is to make this up and running in 4 hrs. Use all your mind capabilities to solve this as quickly as you can and live rest of your weekend relaxed.
1.Following are the steps you need to perform in the network according to the given layout. Configure this scenario and find your given IP address in the file " IP address " attached with this. Find out the Network Addresses and start working with them. And Use them as you want.
2.Please find the Number of required host per subnet in the given file and. Each Student is given different number of required host per subnet. Networks are labeled Alphabetically in the given file of IP ADDRESSES.
3.Use EIGRP in First Block for Routing , OSPF with area 1 in Second Block , Rip in Block Third and OSPF with area 0 in last block as mention on top of the block.
4.Use Redistribution on Router6 and Router12 for connecting EGRP with OSPF and OSPF with RIP.
5.All host in EIGRP, OSPF area 1 and RIP will get IP address from "DHCP Server".
6.You have to use VLSM in each of the 4 Blocks in that topology. ONE Network address for each Block.
7.You have to IMPLEMENT NAT in router with the Network G. Use Private IP Address given to you in the attached file for NATing.
8.You have to attach two PCâ€™s in each network
9.One of the PC of Network L will not allowed to access TFTP server, One of the PC of Network E will not allowed to access Data server, all hosts connected in network A will not allowed to access "Web Server".
